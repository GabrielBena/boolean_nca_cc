# Testing Suite Summary

I broke down the tests into 1: circuit validation, 2: graph representations, 3: knockout pattern generation, 4: masking system, 5: pool management, with critical fixes applied to extraction functions and JAX integration.

## Key Findings

The knockout mechanism correctly prevents damaged nodes from updating during training while allowing active nodes to learn normally, with knockout patterns persisting through the complete pool lifecycle and proper integration with the attention masking system.
