## Test 2: Knockout Evaluation Pipeline Integration ✅

**Status**: Implemented  
**File**: `tests/test_knockout_pipeline_integration.py`  
**Purpose**: Verify vocabulary sampling → pipeline flow → model integration → metrics differentiation  

### Test Coverage

**Critical Path Integration Testing** (mirrors exact usage from `run_knockout_periodic_evaluation`):

1. **✅ Vocabulary → Pattern Sampling Flow**
   - IN-dist: `knockout_vocabulary[pattern_indices]` (samples from vocabulary)
   - OUT-dist: `jax.vmap(pattern_creator_fn)(out_pattern_keys)` (generates fresh patterns)
   - Verified patterns have correct shapes, types, and sources

2. **✅ Training/ID Vocabulary Consistency** 
   - Training reset: samples from vocabulary with `reset_batch_size` 
   - ID evaluation: samples from vocabulary with `eval_batch_size`
   - **Key insight**: Different shapes but same vocabulary source for proper comparison
   - Verified both contain only vocabulary patterns despite different timing/sizing

3. **✅ Pattern Flow Through Pipeline**
   - Complete chain: `run_knockout_periodic_evaluation` → `evaluate_circuits_in_chunks` → `evaluate_model_stepwise_batched` → `vmap_model`
   - Verified patterns flow correctly without corruption
   - Confirmed proper metrics structure returned

4. **✅ Model Knockout Integration**
   - Verified `model(g, knockout_pattern=k)` applies attention masking correctly
   - Confirmed knockout patterns affect node features vs. no-knockout baseline
   - Tested model compatibility with knockout pattern parameter

5. **✅ Metrics Differentiation**
   - IN-dist vs OUT-dist produce statistically different metrics
   - Proper averaging across chunks and batches
   - Verified metric ranges and validity

### Key Architectural Insights Verified

- **Temporal Decoupling**: Pool reset (every 128 epochs) vs evaluation (every 1024 epochs) 
- **Shape Independence**: `num_to_reset` ≠ `eval_batch_size` by design
- **Vocabulary Consistency**: Training and ID use same vocabulary source despite different sample shapes
- **Seed Management**: Deterministic pattern generation with proper seed separation

### Integration Points Tested

```python
# Training reset sampling
sampled_knockout_patterns = knockout_vocabulary[pattern_indices]  # shape: (num_to_reset,)

# ID evaluation sampling  
in_knockout_patterns = knockout_vocabulary[pattern_indices]       # shape: (eval_batch_size,)

# OOD evaluation generation
out_knockout_patterns = jax.vmap(pattern_creator_fn)(out_pattern_keys)  # fresh patterns
```

**Result**: ✅ All verification points passed - knockout evaluation pipeline maintains pattern integrity from vocabulary sampling through final metrics differentiation.
